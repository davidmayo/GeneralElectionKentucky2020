Kentucky's county-by-county certified election results for the 2020 General Election


### Summary
These are the certified county-by-county election results of the 2020 General
Election in Kentucky. The data is from the Kentucky Secretary of state. These
files are the same data as in the original certification document, but put into
CSV form to make them easier to work with for data analysis. No additional
information (percentages, etc.) has been added.

### Data source
The source of the data is this document from the Kentucky Secretary of State:

### Author
The parsing and conversion was done by David Mayo. (I was also the losing
candidate in one of these races, namely State Representative 62nd
Representative District.)

### Disclaimer
The accuracy of the data here is not guaranteed. I have not checked each entry.
I have checked that the county-by-county data for each candidate does sum up to
the listed total for that candidate, and that the totals listed in all races
are accurate. There were no discrepencies found. This work was all done on
2021-01-01 and 2021-01-02.
